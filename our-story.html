            Percoustix didn't start in a lab or a boardroom. It started with two kids who dreamed of making music that mattered. Here's how a friendship, a lot of struggle, and one simple question—<em style="color: var(--cyan);">"What if your guitar could play drums?"</em>—led to something we never imagined.

            YOU'RE NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND THIS NOW, BUT YOU WILL LATER ON. I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS BUT THOSE DREAMS YOU HAVE OF BEING A ROCKSTAR IN A BAND WILL NEVER COME TRUE. I KNOW YOU BADLY WANT IT BUT SOMETIMES DREAMS AREN'T ENOUGH. THE TRUTH IS, ALL OF US ARE MADE FOR MORE THAN WHAT WE CAN IMAGINE.

        <!-- CONCLUSION - Tie back to Percoustix -->
        <div class="story-block full-width" style="text-align: center; max-width: 900px; margin: 40px auto 0;">
          <p class="story-text" style="font-size: clamp(16px, 2.2vw, 20px); line-height: 1.8;">
            That's how Percoustix was born. Not from a business plan, but from a belief that musicians deserve gear that amplifies their creativity, not replaces it. Today, we're bringing drums to your guitar—and putting the power of a full band back in your hands.
